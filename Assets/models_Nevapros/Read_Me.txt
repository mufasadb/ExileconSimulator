If you need get the same render picture like on scrennshots you need to setup you project with PostProcessing package.
You can do this few steps:
1. Install PostProcessing Package. Window->Package Manager->Post Processing 2.3.0->install
2. Add user layer for PostProcessing. Edit->Project Settings->Tags and Layers, select preset or add "PostProcessing" name to any User Layer.
3. Extract "Nevapros. package" to your project.
4. Set "Gamma sapce" to the "Lenear" in your project settings.

Feel free to let me know about any problems with "Nevapros. package".
